**Purpose:** This data set is taken from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set[1]. The data is manipulated to illuststrate proficeincy in implementing and documenting the principles of "Tidy Data" outlined in the course.

**Data Description:** 
The original data set consists from 30 subjects performing six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a Samsung Galaxy S II smartphone.  
The data set was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% is training data and 30% the test data.  
The original data set consists of 561 features of time and frequency domain variables.  


**Methodology:**
The following requirements were given for the course project:  
1.  Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.  
2.  Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each   measurement. 
3.  Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set  
4.  Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.   
5.  Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
